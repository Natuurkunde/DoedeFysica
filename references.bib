   abstract = {This study explored the content and structure of physics teachers’ beliefs on teaching and learning in
general in relation to their domain-specific beliefs. A questionnaire was administered to secondary
school teachers in physics (N = ¼ 126) in the Netherlands. The results showed that beliefs about the general
and domain-specific goals of physics education formed an interrelated belief system consisting of
content-oriented and student-oriented beliefs. Moreover, teachers agreed with the importance of both
teacher-regulated and student-regulated learning. Therefore, research on teachers’ beliefs should go
beyond the often used dichotomy between ‘teacher-focused’ versus ‘student-focused’ education by
focusing on the rationale behind ‘appropriate’ teaching behavior.},

   abstract = {There are continuing educational and political debates about ‘inquiry’ versus
‘direct’ teaching of science. Traditional science instruction has been largely direct
but in the US, recent national and state science education standards advocate
inquiry throughout K-12 education. While inquiry-based instruction has the
advantage of modelling aspects of the nature of real scientific inquiry, there is little
unconfounded comparative research into the effectiveness and efficiency of the
two instructional modes for developing science conceptual understanding. This
research undertook a controlled experimental study comparing the efficacy of
carefully designed inquiry instruction and equally carefully designed direct
instruction in realistic science classroom situations at the middle school grades.
The research design addressed common threats to validity. We report on the nature
of the instructional units in each mode, research design, methods, classroom
implementations, monitoring, assessments, analysis and project findings.},

   abstract = {Design activities, when embedded in an inquiry cycle and appropriately scaffolded and
supplemented with reflection, can promote the development of the habits of mind (scientific
abilities) that are an important part of scientific practice. Through the Investigative
Science Learning Environment (ISLE), students construct physics knowledge by
engaging in inquiry cycles that replicate the approach used by physicists to construct
knowledge. A significant portion of student learning occurs in ISLE instructional labs
where students design their own experiments. The labs provide an environment for
cognitive apprenticeship enhanced by formative assessment. As a result, students develop
interpretive knowing that helps them approach new problems as scientists. This
article describes a classroom study in which the students in the ISLE design lab performed
equally well on traditional exams as ISLE students who did not engage in design activities.
However, the design group significantly outperformed the non-design
group while working on novel experimental tasks (in physics and biology), demonstrating
the application of scientific abilities to an inquiry task in a novel content domain.
This research shows that a learning environment that integrates cognitive apprenticeship
and formative assessment in a series of conceptual design tasks provides a
rich context for helping students build scientific habits of mind.},

   abstract = {The physics laboratory has long been a distinctive feature of physics education. It has been given a central role in the teaching and learning of physics at school and undergraduate levels in universities. The literature indicates that science educators have suggested that there are academically rich benefits in the learning and understanding of physics based on laboratory work. However, some educators have begun to raise serious and valid questions about the effectiveness of the learning through laboratory work in science subjects and the heavy cost for the establishment and maintenance of laboratories. This research paper provides perspectives on these issues through a brief review of the history, goals and objectives related to the physics undergraduate laboratory. An empirical research study was conducted to determine the university students' perceptions, views and opinions with regard to physics learning during undergraduate laboratory work. This involved 143 students from first and higher years and the evidence was gathered by survey and focus group interviews, the former using a variety of types of questions. The evidence from the students is positive and suggests that undergraduate physics laboratory work may well be contributing towards the achievement of specific desirable goals.

   abstract = {In this study a two-sample, pre/posttest, quasi-experimental design was used to investigate the effect of explicit problem-solving instruction on high school students’ conceptual understanding of physics. Eight physics classes, with a total of 145 students, were randomly assigned to either a treatment or comparison group. The four treatment classes were taught how to use an explicit problem-solving strategy, while the four comparison classes were taught how to use a textbook problem-solving strategy. Students’ problem-solving performance and conceptual understanding were assessed both before and after instruction. The results indicated that the explicit strategy improved the quality and completeness of students’ physics representations more than the textbook strategy, but there was no difference between the two strategies on match of equations with representations, organization, or mathematical execution. In terms of conceptual understanding, there was no overall difference between the two groups; however, there was a significant interaction between the sex of the students and group. The explicit strategy appeared to benefit female
students, while the textbook strategy appeared to benefit male students. The implications of these results for physics instruction are discussed.},

work is virtually unthinkable. One could even go so far as saying that it is extremely rare for
anyone to question the necessity of laboratory work in either high school or university science curricula.
Laboratory work is simply part of the science game. This article discusses the problems concerning
the use of the laboratory as didactic tool in the educational process, the premises underlying
its use in science education and different approaches to its implementation as described in recent
literature. This article is primarily directed at a clarification and explicitation of objectives and of
their implementation in laboratory work at the Dutch Open University. The effective and efficient
use of time spent in the laboratory is a necessity for all educational institutions, but especially for
an institution for distance education.},

Challenges are discussed that must be faced if recently developed activity-based approaches to teaching based on the outcome of physics education research are to provide a foundation for a major paradigm shift in physics teaching.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Although engineering education has evolved in ways that improve the readiness of graduates to meet the
challenges of the twenty-first century, national and international organizations continue to call for change.
Future changes in engineering education should be guided by research on expertise and the learning
processes that support its development.
PURPOSE
The goals of this paper are: to relate key findings from studies of the development of expertise to engineering
education, to summarize instructional practices that are consistent with these findings, to provide
examples of learning experiences that are consistent with these instructional practices, and finally, to identify
challenges to implementing such learning experiences in engineering programs.
SCOPE/METHOD
The research synthesized for this article includes that on the development of expertise, students’
approaches to learning, students’ responses to instructional practices, and the role of motivation in learning.
In addition, literature on the dominant teaching and learning practices in engineering education is
used to frame some of the challenges to implementing alternative approaches to learning.
CONCLUSION
Current understanding of expertise, and the learning processes that develop it, indicates that engineering
education should encompass a set of learning experiences that allow students to construct deep conceptual
knowledge, to develop the ability to apply key technical and professional skills fluently, and to engage in a
number of authentic engineering projects. Engineering curricula and teaching methods are often not well
aligned with these goals. Curriculum-level instructional design processes should be used to design and
implement changes that will improve alignment.},

learning pedagogy, is now well supported by evidence. The relevant
data have come from a number of different disciplines that include the
learning sciences, cognitive psychology, and educational psychology.
There is a growing body of research within specific scientific teaching
communities that supports and validates the new approaches to
teaching that have been adopted. These data are reviewed, and their
applicability to physiology education is discussed. Some of the inherent
limitations of research about teaching and learning are also
discussed.},

   abstract = {Humans, especially children, are naturally curious. Yet, people often balk at the thought of learning science--the &quot;eyes glazed over&quot; syndrome. Teachers may find teaching science a major challenge in an era when science ranges from the hardly imaginable quark to the distant, blazing quasar. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards is the book that educators have been waiting for--a practical guide to teaching inquiry and teaching through inquiry, as recommended by the National Science Education Standards. This will be an important resource for educators who must help school boards, parents, and teachers understand &quot;why we can&#039;t teach the way we used to.&quot; &quot;Inquiry&quot; refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and in which students grasp science knowledge and the methods by which that knowledge is produced. This book explains and illustrates how inquiry helps students learn science content, master how to do science, and understand the nature of science. This book explores the dimensions of teaching and learning science as inquiry for K-12 students across a range of science topics. Detailed examples help clarify when teachers should use the inquiry-based approach and how much structure, guidance, and coaching they should provide. The book dispels myths that may have discouraged educators from the inquiry-based approach and illuminates the subtle interplay between concepts, processes, and science as it is experienced in the classroom. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards shows how to bring the standards to life, with features such as classroom vignettes exploring different kinds of inquiries for elementary, middle, and high school and Frequently Asked Questions for teachers, responding to common concerns such as obtaining teaching supplies. Turning to assessment, the committee discusses why assessment is important, looks at existing schemes and formats, and addresses how to involve students in assessing their own learning achievements. In addition, this book discusses administrative assistance, communication with parents, appropriate teacher evaluation, and other avenues to promoting and supporting this new teaching paradigm.},

a multiple-choice test designed to monitor students’ understanding of force
and related kinematics. In this paper we outline how the FCI was used to
evaluate student learning following a newly developed approach to teaching
mechanics in a Finnish upper secondary school. We believe that this case
offers a compelling example of the benefits (in terms of enhanced student
learning) that can follow from research- or evidence-based approaches to
teaching.},

the primary scholarly resources for Technology Education middle school teaching. This
descriptive study identified four main issues that scholars addressed: what should be taught
in middle school, the structure and content of curriculum transformation, integrating
Technology Education with other disciplines, and the impacts of Technology Education
transformation programs on classroom practice. We conclude that, while there has been
considerable effort to move the field from a ‘‘craft/industry/skill’’ approach to focus more
on teaching processes and technological content, the transformation is not complete. In
addition, it appears that both practitioners and theorists will need to focus efforts to
investigate more completely the variables that can influence teachers to conceptualize and
implement new curricular ideas.},

   abstract = {Microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) tools have been developed which interface to Apple 
II and Macintosh computers. Students use these tools to collect physical data that are 
graphed in real time and then can be manipulated and analyzed. The MBL tools have made possible discovery-based laboratory curricula that embody results from educational research. These curricula allow students to take an active role in their learning and encourage them to construct physical knowledge from observation of the physical world. The curricula encourage collaborative learning by taking advantage of the fact that MBL tools present data in an immediately understandable graphical form. This article describes one of the tools-the motion detector (hardware and software)-and the kinematics curriculum. The effectiveness of this curriculum compared to traditional college and university methods for helping students learn basic kinematics concepts has been evaluated by pre- and post-testing and by observation. There is strong evidence for significantly improved learning and retention by students who used the MBL materials, compared to those taught in lecture. },

   abstract = {We conducted a laboratory-based randomized control study to examine the effectiveness of inquirybased
instruction. We also disaggregated the data by student demographic variables to examine if inquiry can provide
equitable opportunities to learn. Fifty-eight students aged 14–16 years old were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
Both groups of students were taught toward the same learning goals by the same teacher, with one group being taught
from inquiry-based materials organized around the BSCS 5E Instructional Model, and the other from materials organized
around commonplace teaching strategies as defined by national teacher survey data. Students in the inquiry-based group
reached significantly higher levels of achievement than students experiencing commonplace instruction. This effect was
consistent across a range of learning goals (knowledge, reasoning, and argumentation) and time frames (immediately
following the instruction and 4 weeks later). The commonplace science instruction resulted in a detectable achievement
gap by race, whereas the inquiry-based materials instruction did not.We discuss the implications of these findings for the
body of evidence on the effectiveness of teaching science as inquiry; the role of instructional models and curriculum
materials in science teaching; addressing achievement gaps; and the competing demands of reform and accountability.},

   abstract = {This study explored the content and structure of physics teachers’ beliefs on teaching and learning in
general in relation to their domain-specific beliefs. A questionnaire was administered to secondary
school teachers in physics (N = ¼ 126) in the Netherlands. The results showed that beliefs about the general
and domain-specific goals of physics education formed an interrelated belief system consisting of
content-oriented and student-oriented beliefs. Moreover, teachers agreed with the importance of both
teacher-regulated and student-regulated learning. Therefore, research on teachers’ beliefs should go
beyond the often used dichotomy between ‘teacher-focused’ versus ‘student-focused’ education by
focusing on the rationale behind ‘appropriate’ teaching behavior.},

   abstract = {There are continuing educational and political debates about ‘inquiry’ versus
‘direct’ teaching of science. Traditional science instruction has been largely direct
but in the US, recent national and state science education standards advocate
inquiry throughout K-12 education. While inquiry-based instruction has the
advantage of modelling aspects of the nature of real scientific inquiry, there is little
unconfounded comparative research into the effectiveness and efficiency of the
two instructional modes for developing science conceptual understanding. This
research undertook a controlled experimental study comparing the efficacy of
carefully designed inquiry instruction and equally carefully designed direct
instruction in realistic science classroom situations at the middle school grades.
The research design addressed common threats to validity. We report on the nature
of the instructional units in each mode, research design, methods, classroom
implementations, monitoring, assessments, analysis and project findings.},

   abstract = {Design activities, when embedded in an inquiry cycle and appropriately scaffolded and
supplemented with reflection, can promote the development of the habits of mind (scientific
abilities) that are an important part of scientific practice. Through the Investigative
Science Learning Environment (ISLE), students construct physics knowledge by
engaging in inquiry cycles that replicate the approach used by physicists to construct
knowledge. A significant portion of student learning occurs in ISLE instructional labs
where students design their own experiments. The labs provide an environment for
cognitive apprenticeship enhanced by formative assessment. As a result, students develop
interpretive knowing that helps them approach new problems as scientists. This
article describes a classroom study in which the students in the ISLE design lab performed
equally well on traditional exams as ISLE students who did not engage in design activities.
However, the design group significantly outperformed the non-design
group while working on novel experimental tasks (in physics and biology), demonstrating
the application of scientific abilities to an inquiry task in a novel content domain.
This research shows that a learning environment that integrates cognitive apprenticeship
and formative assessment in a series of conceptual design tasks provides a
rich context for helping students build scientific habits of mind.},

   abstract = {The physics laboratory has long been a distinctive feature of physics education. It has been given a central role in the teaching and learning of physics at school and undergraduate levels in universities. The literature indicates that science educators have suggested that there are academically rich benefits in the learning and understanding of physics based on laboratory work. However, some educators have begun to raise serious and valid questions about the effectiveness of the learning through laboratory work in science subjects and the heavy cost for the establishment and maintenance of laboratories. This research paper provides perspectives on these issues through a brief review of the history, goals and objectives related to the physics undergraduate laboratory. An empirical research study was conducted to determine the university students' perceptions, views and opinions with regard to physics learning during undergraduate laboratory work. This involved 143 students from first and higher years and the evidence was gathered by survey and focus group interviews, the former using a variety of types of questions. The evidence from the students is positive and suggests that undergraduate physics laboratory work may well be contributing towards the achievement of specific desirable goals.

   abstract = {In this study a two-sample, pre/posttest, quasi-experimental design was used to investigate the effect of explicit problem-solving instruction on high school students’ conceptual understanding of physics. Eight physics classes, with a total of 145 students, were randomly assigned to either a treatment or comparison group. The four treatment classes were taught how to use an explicit problem-solving strategy, while the four comparison classes were taught how to use a textbook problem-solving strategy. Students’ problem-solving performance and conceptual understanding were assessed both before and after instruction. The results indicated that the explicit strategy improved the quality and completeness of students’ physics representations more than the textbook strategy, but there was no difference between the two strategies on match of equations with representations, organization, or mathematical execution. In terms of conceptual understanding, there was no overall difference between the two groups; however, there was a significant interaction between the sex of the students and group. The explicit strategy appeared to benefit female
students, while the textbook strategy appeared to benefit male students. The implications of these results for physics instruction are discussed.},

work is virtually unthinkable. One could even go so far as saying that it is extremely rare for
anyone to question the necessity of laboratory work in either high school or university science curricula.
Laboratory work is simply part of the science game. This article discusses the problems concerning
the use of the laboratory as didactic tool in the educational process, the premises underlying
its use in science education and different approaches to its implementation as described in recent
literature. This article is primarily directed at a clarification and explicitation of objectives and of
their implementation in laboratory work at the Dutch Open University. The effective and efficient
use of time spent in the laboratory is a necessity for all educational institutions, but especially for
an institution for distance education.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND
Although engineering education has evolved in ways that improve the readiness of graduates to meet the
challenges of the twenty-first century, national and international organizations continue to call for change.
Future changes in engineering education should be guided by research on expertise and the learning
processes that support its development.
PURPOSE
The goals of this paper are: to relate key findings from studies of the development of expertise to engineering
education, to summarize instructional practices that are consistent with these findings, to provide
examples of learning experiences that are consistent with these instructional practices, and finally, to identify
challenges to implementing such learning experiences in engineering programs.
SCOPE/METHOD
The research synthesized for this article includes that on the development of expertise, students’
approaches to learning, students’ responses to instructional practices, and the role of motivation in learning.
In addition, literature on the dominant teaching and learning practices in engineering education is
used to frame some of the challenges to implementing alternative approaches to learning.
CONCLUSION
Current understanding of expertise, and the learning processes that develop it, indicates that engineering
education should encompass a set of learning experiences that allow students to construct deep conceptual
knowledge, to develop the ability to apply key technical and professional skills fluently, and to engage in a
number of authentic engineering projects. Engineering curricula and teaching methods are often not well
aligned with these goals. Curriculum-level instructional design processes should be used to design and
implement changes that will improve alignment.},

changes being called for, employment of student-centered, active

data have come from a number of different disciplines that include the
learning sciences, cognitive psychology, and educational psychology.
There is a growing body of research within specific scientific teaching
communities that supports and validates the new approaches to
teaching that have been adopted. These data are reviewed, and their
applicability to physiology education is discussed. Some of the inherent
limitations of research about teaching and learning are also
discussed.},

   abstract = {Humans, especially children, are naturally curious. Yet, people often balk at the thought of learning science--the &quot;eyes glazed over&quot; syndrome. Teachers may find teaching science a major challenge in an era when science ranges from the hardly imaginable quark to the distant, blazing quasar. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards is the book that educators have been waiting for--a practical guide to teaching inquiry and teaching through inquiry, as recommended by the National Science Education Standards. This will be an important resource for educators who must help school boards, parents, and teachers understand &quot;why we can&#039;t teach the way we used to.&quot; &quot;Inquiry&quot; refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and in which students grasp science knowledge and the methods by which that knowledge is produced. This book explains and illustrates how inquiry helps students learn science content, master how to do science, and understand the nature of science. This book explores the dimensions of teaching and learning science as inquiry for K-12 students across a range of science topics. Detailed examples help clarify when teachers should use the inquiry-based approach and how much structure, guidance, and coaching they should provide. The book dispels myths that may have discouraged educators from the inquiry-based approach and illuminates the subtle interplay between concepts, processes, and science as it is experienced in the classroom. Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards shows how to bring the standards to life, with features such as classroom vignettes exploring different kinds of inquiries for elementary, middle, and high school and Frequently Asked Questions for teachers, responding to common concerns such as obtaining teaching supplies. Turning to assessment, the committee discusses why assessment is important, looks at existing schemes and formats, and addresses how to involve students in assessing their own learning achievements. In addition, this book discusses administrative assistance, communication with parents, appropriate teacher evaluation, and other avenues to promoting and supporting this new teaching paradigm.},

offers a compelling example of the benefits (in terms of enhanced student

   abstract = {We review articles published between 1995 and 2008 in four journals that are
the primary scholarly resources for Technology Education middle school teaching. This
descriptive study identified four main issues that scholars addressed: what should be taught
in middle school, the structure and content of curriculum transformation, integrating
Technology Education with other disciplines, and the impacts of Technology Education
transformation programs on classroom practice. We conclude that, while there has been
considerable effort to move the field from a ‘‘craft/industry/skill’’ approach to focus more
on teaching processes and technological content, the transformation is not complete. In
addition, it appears that both practitioners and theorists will need to focus efforts to
investigate more completely the variables that can influence teachers to conceptualize and
implement new curricular ideas.},

   abstract = {Microcomputer-based laboratory (MBL) tools have been developed which interface to Apple 
II and Macintosh computers. Students use these tools to collect physical data that are 
graphed in real time and then can be manipulated and analyzed. The MBL tools have made possible discovery-based laboratory curricula that embody results from educational research. These curricula allow students to take an active role in their learning and encourage them to construct physical knowledge from observation of the physical world. The curricula encourage collaborative learning by taking advantage of the fact that MBL tools present data in an immediately understandable graphical form. This article describes one of the tools-the motion detector (hardware and software)-and the kinematics curriculum. The effectiveness of this curriculum compared to traditional college and university methods for helping students learn basic kinematics concepts has been evaluated by pre- and post-testing and by observation. There is strong evidence for significantly improved learning and retention by students who used the MBL materials, compared to those taught in lecture. },

   abstract = {We conducted a laboratory-based randomized control study to examine the effectiveness of inquirybased
instruction. We also disaggregated the data by student demographic variables to examine if inquiry can provide
equitable opportunities to learn. Fifty-eight students aged 14–16 years old were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
Both groups of students were taught toward the same learning goals by the same teacher, with one group being taught
from inquiry-based materials organized around the BSCS 5E Instructional Model, and the other from materials organized
around commonplace teaching strategies as defined by national teacher survey data. Students in the inquiry-based group
reached significantly higher levels of achievement than students experiencing commonplace instruction. This effect was
consistent across a range of learning goals (knowledge, reasoning, and argumentation) and time frames (immediately
following the instruction and 4 weeks later). The commonplace science instruction resulted in a detectable achievement
gap by race, whereas the inquiry-based materials instruction did not.We discuss the implications of these findings for the
body of evidence on the effectiveness of teaching science as inquiry; the role of instructional models and curriculum
materials in science teaching; addressing achievement gaps; and the competing demands of reform and accountability.},
